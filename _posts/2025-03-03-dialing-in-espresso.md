Dialing in your espresso is a crucial skill for any home barista. It's the process of adjusting various parameters to extract the best possible flavor from your coffee beans.

## The Key Variables

When dialing in, focus on these primary variables:

1. **Grind Size**: Perhaps the most important factor. Too coarse and your shot will be under-extracted (sour). Too fine and it will be over-extracted (bitter).

2. **Dose**: The amount of coffee grounds you use. Typically ranges between 16-20 grams for a double shot.

3. **Yield**: The amount of liquid espresso produced. A 1:2 ratio (e.g., 18g in, 36g out) is a good starting point.

4. **Time**: A properly dialed shot usually takes between 25-30 seconds from the moment you start the pump.

## The Dialing In Process

Start with a standard recipe: 18g of coffee yielding 36g of espresso in about 28 seconds. From there, adjust one variable at a time:

- If the shot is flowing too fast and tastes sour, make the grind finer.
- If the shot is flowing too slow and tastes bitter, make the grind coarser.

Keep detailed notes of each adjustment using our Espresso Logger app to track your progress and find your perfect recipe.

Remember, different beans will require different settings, so dialing in is an ongoing process that's part of the joy of home espresso!
